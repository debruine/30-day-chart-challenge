# Overview {-}

This is my first year participating in the [30-day chart challenge](https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge/Edition2022). In my work with [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io), we do almost everything in bookdown, so I thought I'd make a book with our open-source [PsyTeachR template](https://psyteachr.github.io/template/).

I'm going to use data simulation for most of my charts, so this will also end up being a resource for how to simulate different types of data.
